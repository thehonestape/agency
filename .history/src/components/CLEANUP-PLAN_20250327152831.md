# Component System Cleanup Plan

## 1. Consolidate Shell Components
- [x] `ui/shell/` is our source of truth for layout system
- [ ] Move relevant components from `application-shells/` to `ui/shell/`
- [ ] Remove `application-shells/` directory
- [ ] Move relevant components from `layouts/` to `ui/shell/`
- [ ] Remove `layouts/` directory

## 2. Consolidate UI Components
Current source of truth: `@/components/ui/`

### 2.1 Form Components
- [ ] Move components from `forms/` to `ui/form/`
- [ ] Move components from `elements/` that are form-related to `ui/form/`
- [ ] Delete old directories

### 2.2 Data Display
- [ ] Move components from `data-display/` to `ui/data-display/`
- [ ] Move relevant components from `elements/` to `ui/data-display/`
- [ ] Delete old directories

### 2.3 Navigation
- [ ] Move components from `navigation/` to `ui/navigation/`
- [ ] Move components from `store-navigation/` to `ui/navigation/`
- [ ] Delete old directories

### 2.4 Typography
- [ ] Move components from `headings/` to `ui/typography/`
- [ ] Move text-related components from `elements/` to `ui/typography/`
- [ ] Delete old directories

### 2.5 Marketing Components
- [ ] Move relevant components from `page-sections/` to `ui/marketing/`
- [ ] Move relevant components from `blocks/` to `ui/marketing/`
- [ ] Delete old directories

## 3. Consolidate Pattern Library
- [ ] Create `patterns/` directory for complex, composed components
- [ ] Move relevant components from `ui-blocks/` to `patterns/`
- [ ] Move relevant components from `page-examples/` to `patterns/`
- [ ] Delete old directories

## 4. Theme System Cleanup
- [ ] Consolidate `themes/`, `theme/`, `theme-editor/` into single theme system
- [ ] Move theme components to `ui/theme/`
- [ ] Delete old theme directories

## 5. Remove Deprecated/Duplicate Components
Delete these directories:
- [ ] `adaptable/`
- [ ] `catalyst/`
- [ ] `catalyst-ui/`
- [ ] `catalyst-ui-kit/`
- [ ] `salient/`
- [ ] `protocol/`
- [ ] `examples/`
- [ ] `demo/`

## 6. Cleanup Individual Components
Move these to appropriate locations in `ui/`:
- [ ] `AIAssistant.tsx` → `ui/feedback/`
- [ ] `AiFallbackMessage.tsx` → `ui/feedback/`
- [ ] `CreateOrganizationForm.tsx` → `patterns/forms/`
- [ ] `OrganizationList.tsx` → `patterns/lists/`
- [ ] `ProjectDashboard.tsx` → `patterns/dashboard/`
- [ ] `ErrorBoundary.tsx` → `ui/feedback/`

## 7. Final Structure
```
@/components/
├── ui/                  # Base semantic system
│   ├── shell/          # Layout system
│   ├── form/           # Form components
│   ├── data-display/   # Data presentation
│   ├── feedback/       # User feedback
│   ├── navigation/     # Navigation elements
│   ├── layout/         # Layout primitives
│   ├── typography/     # Typography components
│   ├── marketing/      # Marketing components
│   └── theme/          # Theme system
├── blocks/             # Composable content blocks
└── patterns/           # Common UI patterns
    ├── forms/         # Form patterns
    ├── lists/         # List patterns
    └── dashboard/     # Dashboard patterns
```

## 8. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update component imports in all files
- [ ] Update README files
- [ ] Update example pages
- [ ] Update storybook stories

## Execution Strategy
1. Create new directories first
2. Move components with tests and types
3. Update imports in moved files
4. Test each section after moving
5. Remove old directories only after verifying new structure works
6. Create PR for review

## Notes
- Keep git history when moving files
- Update any storybook stories or tests
- Document breaking changes
- Create migration guide for teams
