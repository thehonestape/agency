# Component Library Restructuring - Status Report

## Completed Work

1. **Created new directory structure**
   - Created `layouts/` directory with application and page subdirectories
   - Created `features/` directory with domain-specific components
   - Migrated components from old structure to new structure

2. **Migrated key components**
   - Moved application shells (stacked, sidebar, multi-column) to layouts
   - Moved brand components to features/brand
   - Moved dashboard components to features/dashboard
   - Moved editor components to features/editor
   - Moved auth components to features/auth
   - Moved project components to features/projects
   - Moved marketing components to features/marketing

3. **Created proper index files**
   - Created index.ts files for all new directories
   - Properly exported components from their respective directories

## Current Issues

1. **Duplicate Exports**
   - The main index.ts file has duplicate exports causing TypeScript errors
   - This is because components are being exported from both old and new structures simultaneously

2. **Import Path Updates Needed**
   - Component imports in the application need to be updated to use the new structure
   - This will be a gradual process to avoid breaking the application

## Next Steps

1. **Clean Up Old Components**
   - Once all components are migrated and tested, remove old component directories
   - This will resolve duplicate export issues

2. **Update Application Imports**
   - Systematically update imports throughout the application to use the new structure
   - Start with one feature area (e.g., dashboard) and work through the rest

3. **Address TypeScript Issues**
   - Resolve remaining TypeScript errors by using named exports when necessary
   - Complete component typing for better developer experience

4. **Documentation**
   - Create component documentation for the new structure
   - Include usage examples and component APIs

## Migration Strategy

To smoothly transition to the new component structure:

1. Keep both old and new structures in place temporarily
2. Update imports in the application gradually, feature by feature
3. Test thoroughly after each update
4. Remove old component structure once all imports are updated

## Conclusion

The component library restructuring is well underway. The new structure provides a cleaner, more maintainable organization that will improve developer experience and application performance. The migration process should continue gradually to ensure stability.
