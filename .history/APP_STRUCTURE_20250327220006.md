# Application Structure

This document provides an overview of the application structure and architecture.

## Overall Structure

The application is structured with clear separation of layouts, pages, and components:

```
src/
├── layouts/           # Layout components that provide the structure
├── pages/             # Page components with specific content
├── components/        # Reusable UI components
│   ├── patterns/      # Compound components built from primitives
│   └── ui/            # UI primitives
├── lib/               # Utilities and services
└── App.tsx            # Main application with routing
```

## Layout System

The application uses a layout-based approach for consistent UI:

1. **MainLayout** - For public/marketing pages
   - Uses the AppShell component
   - Applied to routes like `/`, `/pricing`, etc.

2. **DashboardLayout** - For authenticated dashboard pages
   - Uses SideNav and TopBar components 
   - Applied to routes like `/dashboard/*`
   - Provides consistent navigation across dashboard pages

## Component System

The component architecture follows a modular approach:

1. **Core UI Components** (`src/components/ui/*`)
   - Base components with styling (buttons, inputs, cards)
   - Used throughout the application

2. **Pattern Components** (`src/components/patterns/*`) 
   - More complex, composed components
   - Examples: SideNav, TopBar, dashboards

3. **ComponentView** (`src/components/ui/ComponentView.tsx`)
   - Reusable component browser
   - Can be configured for different views and tabs
   - Connected to the component registry

## Component Registry

The app includes a component registry system:

- Each component can be registered with metadata
- Components are discoverable by category, tags, or search
- The ComponentView provides a visual interface to the registry

## Route Structure

The application routing is organized by section:

```jsx
<Routes>
  {/* Public Routes */}
  <Route element={<MainLayout />}>
    <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
    <Route path="/work" element={<div>Work Page</div>} />
    {/* ... other public routes */}
  </Route>

  {/* Dashboard Routes */}
  <Route element={<DashboardLayout />}>
    <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
    <Route path="/dashboard/components" element={<ComponentsPage />} />
    {/* ... other dashboard routes */}
  </Route>
</Routes>
```

## Adding New Pages

To add a new page to the application:

1. Create a new component in the `src/pages/` directory
2. Add it to the appropriate route in `App.tsx`
3. The page will automatically inherit the correct layout

## Data Flow

Pages can be designed to accept different data sources:

1. Mock data for development and testing
2. API-fetched data for production
3. User-provided data for interactive features

This allows for flexible data plugging into the established view structure.
