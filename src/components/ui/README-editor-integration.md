# BlockNote Editor Integration - Troubleshooting Notes

## Summary

We attempted to integrate the BlockNote rich text editor (https://www.blocknotejs.org/) but encountered persistent CSS loading issues. After several approaches, we decided to implement a simple fallback text editor while keeping these notes for future reference.

## Issues Encountered

The main issue was with CSS loading. The BlockNote package uses a specific export structure that conflicted with our build tooling:

```
Error: Package path ./style.css is not exported from package 
/Users/abe/Local Sites/workhorse/agency/node_modules/@blocknote/mantine 
(see exports field in /Users/abe/Local Sites/workhorse/agency/node_modules/@blocknote/mantine/package.json)
```

## Approaches Tried

1. **Direct CSS Import in Components**
   - Importing CSS directly in the components
   - Issue: Path resolution errors with the CSS imports

2. **Global CSS Import in main.tsx**
   - Moving imports to the main application file
   - Issue: Same export resolution errors

3. **Local CSS Copy**
   - Copying the CSS to our own vendor directory
   - Issue: Still had integration issues with BlockNote components

4. **Custom Implementation with Try/Catch**
   - Created implementations with error handling and fallbacks
   - Issue: While this worked for error handling, the core functionality still had CSS issues

## Current Solution

We've implemented a simple textarea-based fallback editor that maintains the basic functionality:
- Text input/output
- Local storage persistence
- Auto-save capabilities
- Light/dark theme support

## Future Integration

To revisit this integration in the future:

1. Check BlockNote documentation for updates on CSS imports
2. Consider using an alternative rich text editor like TipTap or Slate
3. Ensure proper handling of CSS exports in the build configuration
