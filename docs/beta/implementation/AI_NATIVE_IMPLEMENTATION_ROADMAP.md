# AI-Native Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines our accelerated plan for implementing the Workhorse platform with a persistent AI assistant powered by Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP). We'll focus on launching an MVP quickly while building out the full feature set in parallel.

## Implementation Philosophy

Our implementation follows these key principles:

1. **MVP First**: Launch a minimal viable product as quickly as possible
2. **Parallel Development**: Work on frontend and backend simultaneously
3. **AI-First Design**: Design all features with AI capabilities in mind from the start
4. **Continuous AI Assistance**: Use AI tools (like Claude) throughout the development process
5. **Iterative Improvement**: Launch early, then improve based on real user feedback

## Working Together with AI

To accelerate development, we'll work together using the following approach:

### Daily Sprints

- **Morning Planning** (30 minutes)
  - Review previous day's progress
  - Set clear objectives for the day
  - Identify potential blockers

- **Implementation Sessions** (2-3 hours)
  - Focused coding with AI assistance
  - Real-time problem solving
  - Parallel work on frontend and backend

- **Evening Review** (30 minutes)
  - Evaluate day's progress
  - Document completed work
  - Plan for next day

### Continuous Documentation

- Document features as they're implemented
- Create user guides alongside development
- Update roadmap based on progress

## Success Criteria for MVP

1. **Usability**: Users can create and manage brands with AI assistance
2. **Performance**: System responds quickly to user interactions
3. **Stability**: No critical bugs or crashes
4. **Value**: AI assistant provides genuinely helpful guidance
5. **Adoption**: Users return to the platform after initial use

## Next Steps

1. Set up the frontend Next.js application
2. Create the basic AI assistant UI component
3. Implement the brand creation and management flow
4. Deploy the MVP for initial testing

This roadmap will be updated daily as we progress through the implementation to reflect our current status and any changes to the plan.
